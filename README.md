Describes the Data Industry and the major aspects of the Data Engineering Process
Starting with a descriptive overview diagram. 

Doing Industry Description and accounting for industry change is an important and practical art that I have developed over my career.  I learned industry assessment while working for a mainfrmae developer. Later, I was employed by McGraw-Hill at Osbore McGraw-HIll to update the Cook-Osborne Osborne Business System Buyers Guide. More recently, in 2021, I worked in the Data Industry and I came up with the diagram provided here.  The Data Industry deals with:
- External data formats we may need to deal with
- Programs such as DBT and FiveTran that do "take-off" that can read special formats
- Data Transfer programs like Airflow-Airtable and MQ Series Programs that move data
- Data repository systems: Databases and Data Lakes that feed other systems.
- Machine Learning MLOPS:   Hadoop/MapReduce: and Spark ML processing systems, TensorFLow,Torch
- BI Tools: Business Intelligence: Tableau, Power BI,
- AI Artificial Intelligence systems.
