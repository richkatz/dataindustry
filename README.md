Describes the Data Industry and the major aspects of the Data Engineering Process
Starting with a descriptive overview diagram. 

Doing Industry Description and accounting for industry change is an important and practical art that I have developed over my career.  I learned industry assessment while working for a mainfrmae developer. Later, I was employed by McGraw-Hill at Osbore McGraw-HIll to update the Cook-Osborne Osborne Business System Buyers Guide. More recently, in 2021, I worked in the Data Industry and I came up with the diagram provided here.  The Data Industry deals with:
- External data formats we may need to deal with
- Programs such as DBT and FiveTran that do "take-off" that can read special formats
- Data Transfer programs like Airflow-Airtable and MQ Series Programs that move data
- Data repository systems: Databases and Data Lakes that feed other systems.
- Machine Learning MLOPS:   Hadoop/MapReduce: and Spark ML processing systems, TensorFLow,Torch
- BI Tools: Business Intelligence: Tableau, Power BI,
- AI Artificial Intelligence systems.

The Data Industry and Data Engineering may be and often are employed to deal with regulatory requirements. For instance, at Bechtel we provided critical information about power plant structural safety,  When I worked at Guideant, we built SQL systems to answer regulatory requirements for the FDA.
Note that the data industry is undergoing change.  Especially due to the development of AI, the systems identified in the diagrams will supplanted or replaced by new systems. I wuld estimate that there will be some 40 to 60 additional program systems that have been started even in just the past 4 months.  --- Rich
